                <h2>About Me</h2>        
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I was born in Canada but grew up in the Caribbean, on the twin island state of 
                    <a href="https://www.visitantiguabarbuda.com/" target="_blank"> Antigua and Barbuda.</a> 
                    <br>
                    I returned to Canada to attend university after completing my A-Level's in 1999. I completed my undergraduate studies in Nova Scotia, then moved to Alberta in 2006.
                    <br>
                    I have been living and working in Calgary ever since.

                    <a href="html-bio-with-css.html">Here</a> is a link to my bio page.        
                </p>
                <h2> Education and Work Experience</h2>
                <p>I have bachelor's in Biology with a minor in Math and Chemistry from 
                   <a href="https://www.dal.ca" target="_blank">Dalhousie University</a>. 
                   I completed 2 years of Law school then opted to take some time off to gain work experience.
                   <br>
                   I have 17 years of experience working in the telecomunications industry, doing everything from front-line customer service to corporate account management to working in the dispute resolution management team handling complaints to the CRTC. 
                   <br>
                    I am currenty enrolled in the DTTP Web Development Program offered by SkillHat, learning the basics of web develpment and expanding my areas of expertise. 
                </p>        
                <h2>Hobbies, Interests and Fun Facts</h2>
                <p>I'm a quiet, motivated and down to earth individual with an inquisitive mind and an appreiciation for logical thought. 
                   <br>
                   I am passionate about problem-solving and enjoy finding creative ways to accomplish goals. 
                   <br>
                   In my downtime, I love playing video games, watching movies and playing basketball.
                   <br>
                   My favorite video game series is The Legend of Zelda (<em>Ocarina of Time on the N64 and Breath of the Wild on the Switch both re-defined gaming in my opinion!</em>).
                   <br>
                   My favorite movie is The Matrix (<em>this movie set such a high bar with a thought-provoking plot and action sequences that still visually hold up almost a quarter-century later!</em>).
                   <br>
                    I also enjoy travelling and hope to see the far east (Japan, Singapore, Indonesia) in the coming years.
